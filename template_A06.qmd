# Instructions

1. **Write your name** on the assignment

2. Write your code in the *Code* cells of the **template provided** to write solutions for the assignment. **Do not open a new qmd**, and work from scratch. Ensure that the solution is written neatly enough to understand and grade.

3. You may talk to a friend, discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. Do not use AI to solve the problems.

4. There are point deductions if your code is not clean and organized.

5. Only print what is asked for. Highly inefficient code will be deducted for because it demonstrates lack of understanding.

6. Render as an HTML and **submit BOTH the .qmd and HTML file**.

The grader cannot grade what they cannot see! Failure to render your document after completing all questions will lead to deductions.

## Question 1 (5 points)

## Question 2 (8 points)

Consider the list of lists below containing basketball player information.

```{r}
player_info <- list(MJ = list(name = "Michael Jordan",
                              postion = "shooting guard",
                              games_played = 179,
                              points = 5987,
                              assists = 1022),
                    LJ = list(name = "LeBron James",
                              postion = "small forward",
                              games_played = 287,
                              points = 8162,
                              assists = 2067),
                    KB = list(name = "Kobe Bryant",
                              postion = "shooting guard",
                              games_played = 220,
                              points = 5640,
                              assists = 1040),
                    KA = list(name = "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar",
                              postion = "center",
                              games_played = 237,
                              points = 5762,
                              assists = 767),
                    SO = list(name = "Shaquille O'Neal",
                              postion = "center",
                              games_played = 216,
                              points = 5250,
                              assists = 582))
```


### Part a (1 point)

Extract the value `8162` (LeBron James points) in 2 different ways:

- using indexing 
- using names

```{r}
player_info[[2]][[4]]

player_info$LJ$points

```


### Part b (3 points)

Add a new named element to the end of each player's list called `height`. The heights in inches are as follows: MJ = 78; LJ = 81; KB = 78; KA = 86; SO = 85.

Print the `player_info` list to prove you were successful.

```{r}
heights <- c(MJ=78, LJ=81, KB =78, KA=86, SO = 85)

player_info <- lapply(names(player_info), function(player) {
  player_info[[player]]$height <- unname(heights[player]) #unname prints without name "MJ", "LJ", etc
  return(player_info[[player]]) 
})
names(player_info) <- names(heights)

print(player_info)

```


### Part c (3 points)

Create a new list that contains elements corresponding to each player's `points_per_game`. 

- `points_per_game = points/games_played`

Name each element with the respective player's initials.

ie: The first element of the list will be 33.44693 and the name of this element will be MJ.

Hint: initialize an empty list

Note: this must still run correctly even if the values were to change or if another player were added to the list or if the player order changed.

```{r}
list_points_per_game <- list()

for (player in names(player_info)) { #iterates through names, finds points/games played
  points_per_game <- player_info[[player]]$points / player_info[[player]]$games_played
  list_points_per_game[[player]] <- points_per_game
}

print(list_points_per_game)

```


### Part d (1 point)

Use the list created in Part c and an appropriate apply function to round each value to two decimal places.

Store the output as a vector and print the results.

```{r}
round_points_per_game <- sapply(list_points_per_game, function(i){round(i,2)}) #rounds each element to 2 d.p.
print(round_points_per_game)
```


## Question 3 (3 points)

Consider the matrix `mat_rand` of random numbers below.

```{r}
rand_num <- c(sample(10:100, 10), sample(100:999, 10), sample(1000:2000, 10))

mat_rand <- matrix(sample(rand_num, 30), ncol = 5)

print(mat_rand)
```

Use an appropriate apply function to round values with 2 digits to the nearest tens, values with 3 digits to the nearest hundreds, and 4 digits to the nearest thousands.

ie: 91 rounds to 90; 173 rounds to 200; 1450 rounds to 1000

Hint: use `MARGIN = 1:2` to apply the function to each value instead of only a row/col.

```{r}
#function uses less than 100, 1000 as max values to obtain digits
my_func <- function(x) {
  if(x<100) {
    return(round(x, -1))
  } else if (x <1000) {
    return(round(x,-2))
  } else {
    return(round(x, -3))
  }
}


round_mat <- apply(mat_rand, MARGIN= 1:2, my_func) #MARGIN = 1:2 - applies to both column and rows 

print(round_mat)

```


## Question 4 (9 points)

Run the below code chunk to load a data frame named `max_temps` into your Environment. May need to install `tidyverse` and `janitor` first in order for this to run. You can install packages by clicking on the **Packages** tab in the bottom right pane followed by clicking **Install**.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

temp_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biodash/biodash.github.io/master/assets/data/temperature/co_oh_va_max_temp.txt'
temp_file <- 'state_max_temps.tsv'
download.file(url = temp_url, destfile = temp_file)

max_temps <- read_tsv("state_max_temps.tsv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

### Part a (2 points)

Calculate the average temperature for each month across the whole data frame (using the data for all three states together).

```{r}

average_temps <- apply(max_temps[,3:14], 2, mean) #[,3:4] goes through 3rd to 14th column, leaves rows alone

print(average_temps)

```


### Part b (2 points)

Create three new data frames by slicing the data by state.

- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Colorado (CO).
- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Ohio (OH).
- Slice the data frame to only include the state of Virginia (VA).

No need to print any output here.

```{r}
co_mat <- max_temps[max_temps$state == "CO",]
oh_mat <- max_temps[max_temps$state == "OH",]
va_mat <- max_temps[max_temps$state == "VA",]

```


### Part c (5 points)

Calculate the **median annual** temperature for your Colorado data set. 

Use the `which.max()` and `which.min()` function to determine which year had the highest median temperature and which year had the lowest median temperature.

Then print the sentence:

"The maximum median annual temperature of {} occurred in {} and the minimum median annual temperature of {} occurred in {}."

Example (this is NOT the answer just an example of what goes in the {}):

"The maximum median annual temperature of 68.25 occurred in 2017 and the minimum median annual temperature of 57.15 occurred in 1907."

Note: This code should still run successfully even if the numbers were to change.

```{r}
co_median <- apply(co_mat[,3:14], 1, median)
#print(co_median) - print to check median temperatures 

max_temp_yr <- co_mat$year[which.max(co_median)] #indexes maximum median value to find corresponding yr
min_temp_yr <- co_mat$year[which.min(co_median)]
max_med_temp<- max(co_median) #max and min of data set
min_med_temp <- min(co_median)


print(paste0("The maximum median annual temperature of ", max_med_temp, " occurred in ", max_temp_yr, " and the minimum median annual temperature of ", min_med_temp, " occurred in ", min_temp_yr, "." ))


```


## Question 5 (5 points)

Write a recursive function that calculates the sum of the digits in a number. 

Example: The number 312 would return 6 (3 + 1 + 2)

Run your function with 935068.

```{r}
sum_of_dig <- function(x){
  if(x == 0){ #base case
    return(0)
  }else { #recursive case
    last_digit <- x %% 10
    new_num <- x %/% 10
    return(last_digit + sum_of_dig(new_num)) #runs function with the next digit 
  }
}

sum_of_dig(935068)

```
